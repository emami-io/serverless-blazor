# Serverless Blazor Server

This project contains AWS CDK infra and simple blazor server which runs on AWS lambda function which makes the entire project totally serverless.



## Infrastructure
The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It uses the [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/) to compile and execute your project.

## Useful commands

* `dotnet build src` compile this app
* `cdk deploy`       deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`         compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`        emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
